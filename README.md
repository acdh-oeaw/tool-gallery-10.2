# Tool Gallery 10.2 Self-Study Material and Instructions

XML itself is a markup language that provides a flexible way to create structured documents. It's often used for storing and exchanging data on the internet. XML documents consist of text enclosed in tags, which define the structure and meaning of the data.

TEI, on the other hand, is a set of guidelines for encoding textual documents in XML format. Therefore, we recommend that you first start reading material on XML and continue with TEI.

For this purpose, please study the following items:

1. [**What is the Text Encoding Initiative**](https://books.openedition.org/oep/679) by Lou Burnard. The entire book is openly accessible and serves as a comprehensive source for both XML and TEI. However, for our training purposes, we recommend focusing on the following sections:
   - [**The TEI and XML**](https://books.openedition.org/oep/680)
   - [**The structural organization of a TEI document**](https://books.openedition.org/oep/681)
   - [**The TEI Header**](https://books.openedition.org/oep/691)

2. Study the [**10. Manuscription Description Module**](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html), also available as pdf [TEI Guidelines](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/Guidelines.pdf) (p. 335-378).

3. Read the Manuscript Description section in the [**Creating a Digital Scholarly Edition with the Text Encoding Initiative**](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/project-result-content/cfb03c8e-6765-477e-aa4d-e2b162f57068/IO2_Creating%20a%20digital%20edition%20with%20the%20TEI.pdf).

Additionally, we recommend that you watch the online video on YouTube:

[A quick introduction to annotating data with XML in the oXygen editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAVVC1epulU) (by Sarah Lang).


**Please ensure you familiarize yourselves with the basic structure of XML, including elements, opening and closing tags and try to understand the purpose and usage of these TEI elements for representing metadata, structural organization, and textual content.**
